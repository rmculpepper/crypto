@title[#:tag "kdf"]{Key Derivation and Password Hashing}

A key derivation function can be used to derive keys from secret
material that is not directly suitable for use as a key, such as a
passphrase or the result of a key agreement algorithm. Differnt KDFs
have different additional parameters such as work factors and context
information fields.

KDFs with adjustable work factors are also used to store passwords
@cite["HtSSaP" "DUB"]. A KDF is preferable to a simple digest function
(even with a salt) because the work factor can be chosen to make
exhaustively searching the space of likely passwords (typically short
and composed of alpha-numeric characters) costly.


@defproc[(kdf-spec? [v any/c])
         boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a KDF specifier, @racket[#f]
otherwise.

There are two groups of KDF specifiers. The following KDFs have work
factors and are suitable for producing keys from passwords and storing
passwords:

@itemlist[

@item{@racket[(list 'pbkdf2 'hmac _digest-spec)] --- the PBKDF2
function from PKCS#5 @cite{PKCS5} using HMAC of @racket[_digest-spec]
(see @racket[digest-spec?]).}

@;{@item{@racket['bcrypt] --- bcrypt, based on Blowfish with a modified
key schedule @cite{bcrypt}}}

@item{@racket['scrypt] --- scrypt, with work factors for both time and
memory @cite{scrypt}}

@item{@racket['argon2d], @racket['argon2i], @racket['argon2id] ---
variants of Argon2, designed primarily for password hashing
@cite["Argon2" "PHC"]}

]

The following KDFs are suitable for producing keys from the results of
key-agreement algorithms. They are not suitable for storing passwords.

@itemlist[

@item{@racket[(list 'hkdf _digest-spec)] --- the HKDF
extract-then-expand function @cite{HKDF}}

@item{@racket[(list 'concat _digest-spec)] --- the Concatentation
(also called One-Step) KDF from NIST SP 800-56C @cite{SP800-56C} using
a plain digest}

@item{@racket[(list 'concat 'hmac _digest-spec)] --- the
Concatentation KDF @cite{SP800-56C} using HMAC-@racket[_digest-spec]}

@item{@racket[(list 'sp800-108-counter 'hmac _digest-spec)],
@racket[(list 'sp800-108-feedback 'hmac _digest-spec)], and
@racket[(list 'sp800-108-double-pipeline 'hmac _digest-spec)] --- KDF
constructions from NIST SP 800-108 @cite{SP800-108}; this library only
supports 32-bit counters and the standard ordering of components}

@item{@racket[(list 'ans-x9.63 _digest-spec)] --- similar to the
concatenation KDF but with a different order of components, defined by
ANSI @cite{X963}}

]

@history[#:changed "1.3" @elem{Added support for @racket['hkdf],
@racket['concat], @racket['sp800-108-*], and @racket['ans-x9.63]
algorithms.}]
}


@defproc[(kdf-impl? [v any/c])
         boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is an implementation of a
key-derivation function, @racket[#f] otherwise.
}

@defproc[(get-kdf [k kdf-spec?]
                  [factories (or/c crypto-factory? (listof crypto-factory?))
                             (crypto-factories)])
         (or/c kdf-impl? #f)]{

Returns an implementation of KDF @racket[k] from the given
@racket[factories]. If no factory in @racket[factories] implements
@racket[k], returns @racket[#f].
}

@defproc[(kdf [k (or/c kdf-spec? kdf-impl?)]
              [pass bytes?]
              [salt (or/c bytes? #f)]
              [params (listof (list/c symbol? any/c)) '()])
         bytes?]{

Runs the KDF specified by @racket[k] on the password or passphrase
@racket[pass] and the given @racket[salt] and produces a derived key
(or password hash). Additional parameters such as iteration count are
passed via @racket[params].

The salt must be a bytestring (@racket[bytes?]) except in the
following cases: if the KDF is @racket['ans-x9.63], @racket['concat]
with a digest, @racket['sp800-108-counter], or
@racket['sp800-108-double-pipeline], then @racket[salt] must be
@racket[#f]; if the KDF is @racket['hkdf] or @racket['concat] with
HMAC, then @racket[salt] may be either @racket[#f] or a bytestring.

The following parameters are recognized for @racket[(list 'pbkdf2
'hmac _digest)]:

@itemlist[
@item{@racket[(list 'iterations _iterations)] --- number of iterations}
@item{@racket[(list 'key-size _key-size)] --- the size of the output}
]

In 2000 PKCS#5 @cite["PKCS5"] recommended a minimum of 1000
iterations; the iteration count should be exponentially larger today.

The following parameters are recognized for @racket['scrypt]:

@itemlist[
@item{@racket[(list 'N _N)] --- the CPU/memory cost}
@item{@racket[(list 'p _p)] --- the parallelization factor}
@item{@racket[(list 'r _r)] --- the block size}
@item{@racket[(list 'key-size _key-size)] --- the size of the output}
]

In 2009 the original scrypt paper @cite["scrypt"] used parameters such
as 2@superscript{14} to 2@superscript{20} for @racket[_N], 1 for
@racket[_p], and 8 for @racket[_r].

The following parameters are recognized for @racket['argon2d],
@racket['argon2i], and @racket['argon2id]:

@itemlist[
@item{@racket[(list 't _t)] --- the time cost}
@item{@racket[(list 'm _m)] --- the memory cost (in kb)}
@item{@racket[(list 'p _p)] --- the parallelism}
@item{@racket[(list 'key-size _key-size)] -- the size of the output}
]

The following parameters are recognized for the @racket['hkdf],
@racket['concat], @racket['sp800-108-*], and @racket['asn-x9.63]
families of KDFs:

@itemlist[

@item{@racket[(list 'info _info-bytes)] --- additional contextual
information; see @cite["HKDF" "SP800-56A" "SP800-108"] for
recommendations regarding the contents and format of this field}

@item{@racket[(list 'key-size _key-size)] --- the size of the output}

]

         string?]{

Computes a ``password hash'' from @racket[password] suitable for
storage, using the KDF algorithm @racket[k]. The resulting string
contains an identifier for the algorithm as well as the parameters from
@racket[config]. The result also contains an automatically generated salt.
The formats are intended to be compatible with
@hyperlink["https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modular_crypt_format.html"]{Modular
Crypt Format}.

The @racket[config] parameters are nearly the same as for @racket[kdf],
with the following exceptions:

@itemlist[

@item{The @racket['scrypt] algorithm requires a parameter @racket['ln]
specifying the log (base 2) of the iteration count, instead of the
@racket['N] parameter expected by the @racket[kdf] function.}

@item{The @racket['key-size] parameter is not allowed. This library
always generates password hashes with 32 bytes of raw output (before
encoding).}

Check @racket[password] against the password hash @racket[pwh].

If @racket[k] is a KDF implementation (@racket[kdf-impl?]),
@racket[pwh] must have been generated with the same KDF algorithm
(but not necessarily the same implementation); otherwise an exception
is raised. If @racket[k] is @racket[#f], then the KDF algorithm is
extracted from @racket[pwh] and the @racket[(crypto-factories)] list
is searched for an implementation; if no implementation is found an
exception is raised.
