@title[#:tag "factory"]{Cryptography Factories}

This library relies on foreign libraries for the implementations of
cryptographic primitives. Each foreign library is called a
@emph{cryptography provider} and it has an associated @emph{factory}
that maps cryptographic @emph{algorithm specifiers} to
@emph{implementations}.

Cryptography providers may be used to obtain algorithm implementations
either explicitly or implicitly. An implementation of a cryptographic
algorithm may be obtained @emph{explicitly} by calling the appropriate
function (eg, @racket[get-digest], @racket[get-cipher], etc) on a
factory or list of factories. Alternatively, most functions provided
by this library for performing cryptographic operations accept either
a implementation object or an algorithm specifier. If an algorithm
specifier is given, an implementation is @emph{implicitly} sought from
the factories in @racket[(crypto-factories)]; if no implementation is
available, an exception is raised.

@defproc[(crypto-factory? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a crypto factory, @racket[#f]
otherwise.
}

@defparam*[crypto-factories factories
           (or/c crypto-factory? (listof crypto-factory?))
           (listof crypto-factory?)]{

The list of crypto factories used when implicitly finding an
implementation of a cryptographic algorithm from an algorithm
specifier.

The initial value is @racket['()].
}

@defproc[(get-factory [i (or/c digest-impl? digest-ctx?
                               cipher-impl? cipher-ctx?
                               pk-impl? pk-parameters? pk-key?)])
         crypto-factory?]{

Gets the factory associated with a particular cryptographic algorithm
implementation or context.
}

@defproc[(factory-version [factory crypto-factory?])
         (or/c (listof exact-nonnegative-integer?) #f)]{

Returns a list representing the library version associated with
@racket[factory], or @racket[#f] if the library could not be loaded. A
version list starts with the major version number; the total number of
elements depends on the library's versioning conventions. If the
library does not provide version information, the result is @racket['()].
}

@defproc[(factory-print-info [factory crypto-factory?]) void?]{

Prints information about @racket[factory] to the current output
port. In particular, the following information is customarily
included, if relevant:
@itemlist[
@item{the version of the underlying foreign library (if known)}
@item{the available digests}
@item{the available ciphers}
@item{the available PK systems}
@item{the available EC named curves}
@item{the available key-derivation functions}
]
Different crypto providers support different levels of introspection,
so the information is generally provided on a best-effort basis.

@section[#:tag "all"]{All Factories}

@defmodule[crypto/all]

@defthing[all-factories (listof crypto-factory?)]{

A list containing all of the factories available in the library.

Warning: the order of the factories may change in future versions of
this library. This module is intended as a convenience for interactive
use, not for developing libraries or applications.
